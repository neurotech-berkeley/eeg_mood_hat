# EEG Mood Hat

## Introduction

The EEG Mood Hat is artistic EEG visualizer project that works with the Muse to stream, process, and visualize the user EEG data onto an RGB LED matrix! This project is a great way to learn all the essential skills for Neurotech software projects, and a open-ended project that lets you experiment and explore your creative side with neurotechnology!

The project has been split into several sections/phases, each of which you can realistically finish in one or two sessions (hyperlinked below). 

1. Phase 1: Connecting headsets and streaming data
2. Phase 2: Data processing and MNE
3. Phase 3: Machine Learning
4. Phase 4: Circuits
5. Phase 5: Integration and Experimentation

## Phase 1: Connecting Headsets and Streaming Data

The headset you will be using for the base version of this project is the Muse S (image below)
